To run and test each assignment:

Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
Execute the corresponding Python file (.py) for each assignment using a Python environment (e.g., Python IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, or command line).
For example, to run the Guess Number game:
'''p2.1.py'''

Note:
If you encounter any issues while running the code, ensure all Python files are correctly placed in your working directory and that there are no syntax errors.
